# movie_ETL
module 8

We are creating an automated pipline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transfomations, and loads the data into existing tables. By refractoring the code, create one function that takes in Wikipedia data, Kaggle Metadata, and Movielens rating data and perform the ETL process by adding data to PostgreSQL database.

This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:

    Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
    Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
    Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
    Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
